# Multi-Class Classification of Obesity Level using an Artificial Neural Network

Abstract – Current health crises experienced by the world led to less access of people to healthcare monitoring, and obesity have become more prominent in the society. Developing a system that can determine an individual’s obesity level without professional intervention can make healthcare be accessible to everyone. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become more effective lately in determining obesity levels by only asking simple questions regarding lifestyle practices. Using a SMOTE-balanced dataset, this study developed an ANN with an input layer that takes in 16 input features, has two hidden layers activated using the Rectified Linear Unti (ReLU) activation function, and an output layer with a Softmax activation function to classify input into one of the 7 obesity levels. The ANN is evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall rate, logarithmic loss, and AUC – ROC. The ANN model yielded 90.5% accuracy, 91.9% precision, recall rate of 88.8%, logarithmic loss of 0.3, and AUC – ROC of 0.98.
